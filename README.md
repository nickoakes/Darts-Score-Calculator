# Darts-Score-Calculator
A single-page darts score calculator. Initial prompts capture the players' names, which are then displayed on the page above their scores and on the relevant buttons. Scores are kept by first activating a throw for a player, and then clicking on the board to record the darts thrown. Hovering over the treble twenty will cause an image of Phil Taylor to display in place of the Winmau logo, while hovering over the bull will cause an image of 'Bully' from the TV programme "Bullseye' to appear. If a player's score drops below the maximum 3-dart checkout of 170, a link to a checkout chart will appear to assist them. Once a player is on a double (i.e. their score is an even number less than or equal to 50), their score is shown as the double they require in order to checkout, rather than just as a plain number.
